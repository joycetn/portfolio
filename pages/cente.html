     <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Over the duration of three months, we were given the brief to construct a brand identity and target readership for our own unique magazine brand. The final product called for fully designed samples of our printed publication - templates for monthly designs, feature spreads, and page content layout.</p>

     <h3>Design Process</h3>
      <p>I initially wanted my spread to be an anti-beauty beauty magazine. where we would deconstruct beauty standards and celebrate the natural beauty within others. The original name of my publication was "Centella", named after centella asiatica, the scientific name of a calming plant often used within traditional medicine and skincare.</p>

     <h4>Design Iterations</h4>

           <p>Initial cover & logo mockups.</p>
        </div>

     <p>After exploring concepts and iterating through, I discovered that "Centella" was a wordy and not quite catchy name for a publication. Instead, I opted for the name "cente" which slides off the tongue more easily and sounds like "scent" which is apt for a beauty publication.</p>

      <h3>Final Outcome</h3>

       <h4>Takeaways</h4>
        <p>Creating a beauty magazine requires a combination of creative vision, strong editorial skills, and attention to detail to produce a successful and engaging publication. This project helped me hone my skills, especially my attention to detail in order to create what I felt like would be an engaging piece to my audience.</p>
