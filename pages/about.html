     <p>Joycelyn Tng is a UX writer, researcher, designer, and full time crazy girl. (pssst: it's not Jocelyn, it's Joycelyn!) She thinks it's a little strange that everyone writes their about section in third person but enjoys following previously established conventions so she continues to do so here. On her spare time you can find her reading trope-based webnovels about reincarnating as a villainess and going to the sleep clinic to treat her chronic illnesses.</p>
