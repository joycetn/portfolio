     <p> I am a firm believer that having an inclusive design process will create a final product that will make the world more accessible for everyone.
As writer, researcher, and designer, lending an ear to invisible voices and designing inclusive spaces is always my goal. I believe that everyone has a value and important perspectives to consider when it comes to making design decisions.</p>
<p>In my free time, if you can't find me knitting scarves full of holes or reading tower-climbing web comics, you can find me doing some real life climbing at the bouldering gym!</p>
<p>Currently seeking UX and print design opportunities :-)</p>
