     <h3>Overview</h3>
     <p>Nodus was developed over the course of three months for a senior design working closely with design mentors and field experts for a senior design class. </p>

     <h3>Research Phase</h3>
       <p>For this project, we were tasked with making a meaningful design using neuroscience as the basis of our product. We narrowed in on the topic of mental health and explored how we could use neurotechnology to create a product that could improve the lifestyle of patients suffering from PTSD.</p>
       <p>We looked into sound therapy and researched how stimulation of the senses is able to reset the state of the nervous system. We then looked for ways to apply that to patients with PTSD and initially iterated through a wristband that would detect distress signals paired with a bone conduction headband which would deliver haptic vibrations & sound to pull the users attention away from the source of stress.</p>

       <h3>User Testing</h3>
       <p>I primarily conducted the user tests and research. As this is a sensitive topic to approach, in order to understand the wants and needs of our users, we reached out to different communities and various PTSD support groups online. Around 20 people from online communities participated in our surveys, with one of our participants being willing to reach out to conduct a one-on-one in depth interview. From there we were able to deduce their primary wants and concerns about a product that they would want.</p>

         <p>The general consensus from our research was that the main priorities for most of our users was to have a discrete piece of technology that responded to their triggers immediately and did not make them feel othered or singled out in when using in public.</p>


       <h3>Design Iterations</h3>

          <p>Initial mockup of headband and wristband interface.</p>
       </div>

       <p>With this in mind, our initial mockup using a bone conduction headband paired with a wristband was scrapped and we opted for a more discrete looking watch that resembled a smart-watch. The smart-watch interface would allow our users to wear it out in public and not look out of place. As well, our wristband would provide portable, immediate responses in detecting the start of a PTSD attack using heart-rate detection sensors.</p>

         </div>

        <p>Once a trigger is detected, the wristband uses haptic vibrations to alert the user and offers various grounding methods to allow the user to follow along with until the symptoms ease up.</p>

         <p>An app is also paired with the wristband to allow further user customization of grounding techniques and monitor symptoms.</p>

      <h4>Takeaways</h4>
          <p>One of the most difficult things about our project was discussing the sensitive issue of a commonly stigmatized mental health condition in the open. It was also initially difficult to tie in neuroscience with our product and create something novel, as neuroscience was far from my team's area of specialty. As we conducted our user tests and reached out to our users with different iterations, hearing their feedback was exciting!</p>
